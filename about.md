Hello world! This is my initial attempt at curating a website to share what I can do with the world. I developed with webpage using GitHub as a means of practicing and showcasing several different skillsetsâ€“namely my writing skills (via blog posts) and data analysis (via research projects). Bear with me as I continue to learn and please connect to discuss anything I share that catches your eye.

A bit about me: I am a research scientist whose interests lie in understanding how sleep and exercise modulate our health and well-being. 

Yours in Science, 

Tom Gooding, PhD, ATC, CSCS
